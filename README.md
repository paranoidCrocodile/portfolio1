# portfolio1
My first portfolio, to see a live example, go to: https://paranoidcrocodile.github.io/portfolio1/dist/index.html.

## setup
run `npm install` to install dependencies, `npm install --only=dev` to install dev dependencies.

## running the code
run `npm run serve` to start a developmental server. `npm run build` to build a production version. `npm run lint` to run ESLint.

## edit text in the website
navigate to `config.json` in root and edit the property values.
